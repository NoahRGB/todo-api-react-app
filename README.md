# React Todolist App using an API to access the contents of a database
This helped me learn the basics of React as well as the power of APIs.

I built a simple API using Nodejs and the Express package and hosted them using Heroku to modify the contents of a database that was also being hosted on Heroku. The API is fairly simple, and had a few endpoints setup for interacting with the database contents.

This allowed me to investigate the power of APIs by creating the same todolist application using different languages / technologies. For example, I also made an Android app that used the API mentioned to render the same todolist items, creating a synced todolist that renders the same items on my browser as well as on my phone.
