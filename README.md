# React Todolist App using an API to access the contents of a database
This helped me learn the basics of React as well as the power of APIs.

I created a simple ExpressJS API with Node that has a variety of endpoints that modify the information stored in a database. The API and the database were hosted on Heroku for simplicity and cost

I then used the API and database to sync a a 'todo list' across multiple devices / programs. For example, I created this react app that contacts the databse through the API and allows me to see and modify current todo list items online. I also made a simple Android app in Java that contacts the API and allows me to modify the todo list from an app on my phone. 

This has allowed me to see the power of hosting resources online over an API. I've been able to create a small synchronised example of how the same content can be displayed and modified by multiple platforms at the same time.
